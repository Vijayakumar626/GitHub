PdM uses real-time asset data, historical performance data, and advanced analytics to forecast when asset failure will occur. PdM tracks vehicle and asset health and uses data science and analytics to forecast when vehicles and assets will need maintenance so they can be addressed before breakdowns occur. PdM promises cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) Reduced risk<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"409\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/23-July-Robotics-Week-2023.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-730\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Predictive maintenance tools gather and analyze relevant information from individual vehicle profiles and vehicle maintenance history, and because you\u2019re getting accurate vehicle health information, you minimize guesswork when inspecting errors and oversight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get relatively reliable estimates of risks involved because the predictive maintenance software uses quantifiable data, powerful analysis techniques, and precise calculations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2) Reduced downtimes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"952\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ai-and-robotics-2048x952-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-729\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Predictive maintenance programs significantly lessen vehicle downtime.
