However, these insights must translate to tangible results that have a direct impact on their bottom line. They are looking for metrics such as increased customer satisfaction, improved ROI, reduced costs, increased revenue, or improved efficiency of processes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analytics can help put data into an actionable format, such as a dashboard with data points or AI-generated real-time alerts. Ultimately, data analytics should enable managers to create data-driven strategies and policies that will lead to better business decisions and improved performance. By leveraging data analytics and its associated technologies, businesses can make informed decisions that are backed by data, resulting in increased profits and business success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1) <strong>Components of a Data-Driven Decision Support System<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"900\" height=\"418\" src=\"http:\/\/localhost\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/02\/ai-and-robotics-2048x952111111111-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-833\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, data analytics and data-driven decision-making will be more prevalent than ever. As data continues to become a tool for companies to use to their advantage, tools and 3rd party software supporting data analytics have become increasingly valuable in the marketplace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most popular data analysis tools available are dashboard software visualization platforms like Tableau and Power BI. These tools allow data to be visualized in an intuitive way, making it easier for data analysts to explore insights from data quickly. Additionally, these platforms are often equipped with Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities which allow data exploration without any manual input from the user.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other software solutions such as data wrangling tools, data catalogs and data governance systems can also help enhance data analysis. With data wrangling, data scientists are able to transform raw data sets into useful formats for downstream analytics or machine learning models. Data catalogs provide a single source of truth for data within an organization and allow users to find the right data quickly without having to dig through multiple data sources. Lastly, data governance systems allow for a layer of security and compliance when dealing with data within an organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, data analytics is becoming more important than ever before in the world today and visualization tools that help build dynamic dashboards, data wrangling tools, data catalogs and data governance systems are essential components of a solid data-driven decision support system. These tools and software solutions can help data analysts create data-driven decisions quickly and easily in 2023.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Business managers understand that data analytics can provide valuable insights into their operations and help them make better decisions.
